# odin-recipes

This has been a project to build a basic recipe website, as part of 
coursework for The Odin Project. 

I have consolidated my learning of git, Visual Studio Code, html boilerplate, 
heading tags, papargraph tags, ordered and unordered lists, links to pages, 
images and to external websites.
