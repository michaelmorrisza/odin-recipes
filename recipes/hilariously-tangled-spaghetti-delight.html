    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of spaghetti (or as many as you can untangle from the kitchen drawer)</li>
        <li>1 jar of tomato sauce (because let's be real, who has time to make their own?)</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic (or however many you find rolling around in the back of your fridge)</li>
        <li> 1 onion (if it's not sprouting, it's good to go)</li>
        <li>1 cup of grated parmesan cheese (or whatever cheese is left after your midnight snacking)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Begin by attempting to locate your kitchen. If unsuccessful, consider cooking in the living room: it's all about improvisation, right?</li>
        <li>Find your "spaghetti untangling" partner. This can be your best friend, your cat, or that ghost that seems to rearrange things in your house.</li>
        <li>Place the spaghetti on the counter and watch in awe as it becomes an intricate knot only a sailor could love.</li>
        <li>Heat a pot and drop in a tablespoon of confusion. Add a dash of uncertainty and let it simmer.</li>
        <li>Chop the garlic and onion while pretending they are contestants on a reality cooking show. Imagine the drama as they feud over who's the superior flavor enhancer.</li>
        <li>Slowly and carefully (or not, who are we kidding?), separate the tangled mass of spaghetti. This is an art, like untangling Christmas lights, but edible.</li>
        <li>Enlist the help of a spaghetti whisperer if needed: someone who can calm the pasta down with tales of Italian adventures.</li>
        <li>Boil water in a pot. If you forget about it and it evaporates, just pretend you're practicing your magic trick of turning water into air.</li>
        <li>Gently place the spaghetti into the water, giving it the freedom it never knew it craved. Cook until it achieves the perfect blend of 'al dente' and 'how did we get here?'</li>
        <li>Pour the tomato sauce into the pan with the garlic and onion. Let them have a saucy conversation about their dreams and aspirations.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of chaos, a dash of absurdity, and a sprinkle of puns. Stir well while humming the theme song to your favorite sitcom.</li>
        <li>Drain the cooked spaghetti, preferably without creating a tsunami in your kitchen.</li>
        <li>Plate the spaghetti artistically on each dish, making sure to emphasize its wild, untamed nature. It's not messy; it's avant-garde.</li>
        <li>Generously sprinkle grated parmesan cheese over the spaghetti. Imagine you're the star of a food reality show, where cheese is the surprise ending to every episode.</li>
        <li>Sit down to savor your creation. Take a bite and marvel at how the flavors and textures dance the tango on your taste buds.</li>
        <li>Invite your friends over and watch as they try to untangle the spaghetti with forks, knives, and puzzled expressions.</li>
    </ol>
